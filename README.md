# SquadUp

SquadUp is an app created for the TechStars Virtual Hackathon at Sacred Heart University on November 27th, 2020. This project was created over the course of one weekend, and achieved 4th place in the competition. 

## Concept

SquadUp is a mobile app for connecting people who play pickup sports. Users can find and schedule pickup games in real time, and then seamlessly squad up with their new teammates by scanning QR codes to easily join a group chat. In group chats, squads can schedule public or private games, manage participation of their members, and collect payments. Squadup users can also find established clubs with regular meeting times that fit their schedules.
